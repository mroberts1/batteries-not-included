title: "Empty Pockets: Creative Leisure & Unproductive Time"
---

This morning I spent an hour watching the following YouTube videos:

- [A video about a species of microscopic mites that live in millions on your face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZGttZi6L94)
- [A video about the fourth dimension and the concept of the tesseract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI8M_U2QGt0&t=163s)
- [A video clip of a 1959 interview with the philosopher Bertrand Russell in which he answers the question of what message he would like to send to future generations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo&t=3s)
- [A video about Pinecraft, a resort town in Sarasota, Florida, that the BBC describes as the “Amish Las Vegas”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXKrUEgIxLU)

Several of these videos I shared or had already shared on a Facebook group that I belong to called _The Institute of Incoherent Geography_, a revival of the institute of the same name founded by the early filmmaker Georges Méliès in 1904. I shared the Amish video with a New York-based photographer whose work documents subcultures, and a journalist in Mumbai who runs an online news service. For future reference I saved the videos to YouTube playlists with names like “Science” and “Philosophy”.

I don’t have a lot of time to do stuff like this these days. It would usually be filed under an activity that for most of us has replaced television as our go-to guilty pleasure: “wasting time watching random YouTube videos.” While watching these videos, which were only between 2-7 minutes in length, my productivity superego issued continual notifications that I needed to get to those emails that needed to be sent out, to post those announcements on the online courses that I’m currently teaching, to start making those calls to schedule appointments at the dentist, the doctor, the cats’ vet, the tax consultant. I tried - not altogether successfully - to ignore this voice in my head and focus on the videos, but it became more insistent the longer my apparently random video-watching continued. Yet even though what I was doing felt like a case study in what a grad-student friend used to call “displacement activity,” when I broke after the hour to get some breakfast and return to the world of productivity, I felt mentally refreshed and enriched, as if I had grown, however slightly, in my understanding of the world. Rather than “wasted,” I felt that the admittedly unproductive time that I had “invested” in watching the videos had in fact been well “spent”.

In recent months, times like this have been few and far between. They emerge unpredictably as small pockets of time in the interstices of all the activities I’m supposed to be doing, like prepping and teaching classes, grading assignments, grocery shopping, or cleaning out the cats’ litter boxes. While eating breakfast, I found myself musing about whether I should make a point of incorporating larger pockets of time like this into my daily schedule - not necessarily to watch random YouTube videos, but just empty pockets of time with no agenda prescribed by a mental to-do list, in which I could do anything I pleased. I imagined not just an hour, but an entire morning, a day, a week, a month, a year to spend like this. What would it feel like? What would I actually do?

I realized that I needed to take a sabbatical from my life.
